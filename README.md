## Overview

Shop Floor Assistance is a proof-of-concept for agentic manufacturing operations. The idea: instead of an operator manually watching every machine reading, order deadline, and safety log, a set of background agents continuously scan those data sources, raise events when something looks wrong, and a central router decides how serious each event is and which actions to fire — stop a machine, schedule maintenance, reschedule an order, or notify the right role.

The backend is a single FastAPI service. At its core is a global router "graph": a long-running async loop that pulls events off a queue, runs each through a triage step, and executes the tools the triage step asks for. Every action is appended to a shared action log and pushed out over WebSockets, so the React dashboard shows machines, orders, safety logs, and the agent's decision-to-action workflow updating in near real time.

I built this during an AI engineering internship at September AI as a way to demonstrate an event-driven, tool-calling agent architecture on a manufacturing scenario. It runs entirely on local JSON files as the data store, so it stands up without a database. Triage is deterministic by default (a rule-based mock) and can be switched to an OpenAI model with one environment flag.

## Key Features

- **Background monitoring agents** — three async loops continuously scan the data store on independent intervals:
  - *Shop Floor loop* (every 8s): flags any machine whose temperature is over 100°C as a `machine_upset` event.
  - *Order loop* (every 10s): flags orders due within 1 hour but under 80% progress as `order_delay`, computing a delay percentage.
  - *Safety loop* (every 6s): re-raises any safety log still marked `unresolved`.
- **Global router graph** — a singleton `GlobalRouterGraph` backed by an `asyncio.Queue`. It consumes events one at a time, triages each, routes the resulting tool calls, executes them, and records the outcome. It never lets a single bad event crash the loop.
- **Configurable triage** — by default a deterministic `MockLLM` assigns a severity tier and a list of tool calls per event. Flip `USE_OPENAI_TRIAGE=1` and it instead calls an OpenAI chat model and parses strict-JSON triage output, falling back to the deterministic path if the call fails or returns malformed JSON.
- **Severity tiers (S1–S4)** — events are graded from S1 (critical: production stop or safety hazard) down to S4 (informational), each tier mapping to a different set of actions.
- **Tool execution layer** — a fixed tool registry (`stop_machine`, `schedule_maintenance`, `update_order`, `notify`, `log`) that the router dispatches by name with arguments. Unknown tool names return a clean `unknown_tool` result instead of throwing.
- **Supervisor agent** — a separate loop (every 60s) that summarizes the last hour of actions, escalates when there are 3 or more critical notifications, auto-reschedules orders that were recently flagged as delayed, and writes a once-per-day daily summary with state persisted to disk.
- **Real-time dashboard** — a React single-page app with four panels (Machines, Orders, Agent Workflow, Safety Logs). It polls REST endpoints every 5 seconds and also opens a WebSocket for live log entries, triage workflow cards, and safety-resolution updates.
- **Manual event injection** — the dashboard (and the `/publish_event` endpoint) lets you publish ad-hoc events to test scenarios, and resolve safety logs from the UI.
- **Append-only action log** — every tool call and agent decision is written to `action_log.json` via a lock-guarded, atomic temp-file-then-replace write, newest first.
- **In-memory analytics** — the router keeps a `MemoryState` (events processed, counts by category, counts by severity, last triage) exposed at `/memory`.

## How It Works

The whole system is event-driven. Data lives in JSON files; agents read those files, decide whether something is worth raising, and publish events to one central queue. The router is the only thing that acts.

### 1. Data and agent loops

The data store is four JSON files under `server/data/`: `machines.json`, `orders.json`, `safety_logs.json`, and the append-only `action_log.json`. On startup, FastAPI launches all the background loops as asyncio tasks (`shopfloor_loop`, `order_loop`, `safety_log_loop`, the supervisor `loop`, and the router's `run_loop`).

Each agent loop is a simple `while True` that reads its file, checks a condition, and publishes an event dict (`{source, type, payload}`) onto the global queue. For example, the shop floor loop raises a `machine_upset` for any machine over 100°C; the order loop raises an `order_delay` carrying the computed `delay_percent`.

### 2. The router graph

`GlobalRouterGraph.run_loop()` awaits the queue, then runs `process_one()` for each event:

1. **Triage** — the event is validated into a Pydantic `Event` and passed to the triage function, which returns a `TriageOutput` with a severity, a category, a short rationale, and a list of `ToolCall`s.
2. **Route and execute** — `event_router.route_and_execute()` walks the tool calls, normalizes each one, and runs it through the tool registry. Results are collected.
3. **Log and broadcast** — the event, the triage decision, and the executed tools are logged, and the combined result is broadcast over WebSocket as a `triage` message (the dashboard turns it into an Event → Triage → Tools workflow card).
4. **Memory update** — counters for events processed, category, and severity are updated.
5. **Dynamic safety resolution** — if the event came from the safety agent or is an explicit `safety_resolve`, the matching safety log is marked resolved and a `safety_resolved` message is pushed to clients.

### 3. Triage logic

There are two interchangeable triage paths, selected by the `USE_OPENAI_TRIAGE` flag:

- **Deterministic mock (default).** A rule table in `server/llm.py`. Examples of the actual rules:
  - Machine over/upset: temp ≥ 120°C → **S1** (`stop_machine` + `schedule_maintenance` + critical notify); temp ≥ 100°C or vibration ≥ 1.2 → **S2** (warning notify).
  - Order delay: delay ≥ 50% → **S2** (`update_order` to 3h + planner notify); 20–50% → **S3** (info notify).
  - Safety (`ppe_missing` / `unsafe_zone_entry` / `ppe_violation`) → **S1** (critical supervisor notify).
  - Anything else → **S4 / Unknown**, no actions.
- **OpenAI triage (optional).** When enabled, the same event is sent to an OpenAI chat model (default `gpt-4o`) with a strict-JSON instruction; the response is parsed and shape-guarded, and on any error it falls back to the deterministic rules. A prompt pack in `server/prompts/triage_prompt.md` documents the JSON schema, the severity guidance, and few-shot examples used for this path.

### 4. Tools

The tool registry maps names to functions in `server/tools/`. `stop_machine`, `schedule_maintenance`, and `update_order` are "production" actions; `notify` sends a role-targeted message at a level (info/warning/critical); `log` records a generic event. In this PoC the production tools are simulated — they write a structured entry to the action log and return a status — which keeps the architecture honest about *what would be called* without touching real machinery.

### 5. Supervisor

The supervisor loop is the higher-level overseer. Every 60 seconds it reads the action log, builds an hourly summary grouped by action type, escalates if it sees 3+ critical notifications in the window, collects order IDs that were flagged as delayed and auto-reschedules them, and emits a daily summary exactly once per day (tracked in `supervisor_state.json`).

### 6. Frontend

The React app (`frontend/`) renders four panels and keeps them fresh two ways: a 5-second interval that re-fetches `/machines`, `/orders`, `/logs`, and `/safety_logs`, plus a WebSocket (`connectStream`) that handles `log`, `triage`, and `safety_resolved` push messages. The Workflow panel renders each triage result as a three-step card (Event → Triage → Tools) with severity-coloured badges. The Safety panel lets an operator mark a log resolved, which publishes a `safety_resolve` event back through the same router.

### API surface

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/machines` | Current machine states |
| GET | `/orders` | Current orders |
| GET | `/safety_logs` | Safety logs |
| GET | `/logs` | Action log (newest first) |
| GET | `/memory` | Router memory snapshot (counts, last triage) |
| POST | `/publish_event` | Inject an event; `?async_mode=true` enqueues, otherwise processes synchronously |
| WS | `/ws` | Live stream of log, triage, and safety-resolved messages |

## Triage Rules and Demo Data

There are no benchmark/performance numbers here — it's a PoC, not a tuned system. What's concrete is the behaviour and the seed data:

- **Severity model:** four tiers, S1 (critical) → S4 (informational), each mapping to a distinct action set.
- **Thresholds:** machine S1 at ≥ 120°C, S2 at ≥ 100°C or vibration ≥ 1.2; order delay S2 at ≥ 50%, S3 at 20–50%; safety violations always S1.
- **Loop cadence:** shop floor 8s, orders 10s, safety 6s, supervisor 60s.
- **Seed dataset:** 3 machines (one already at 125°C / vibration 1.5, which triggers an S1 on first scan), 3 orders (one due in 0.5h at 90%, one due in 1h at 20%), and 1 safety log. Enough to see the full event → triage → action → log → dashboard cycle the moment the server starts.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python (backend), JavaScript / JSX (frontend), HTML/CSS.
- **Backend frameworks/libraries:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, `python-dotenv`, `aiofiles`, native `asyncio` (queue + background tasks), WebSockets.
- **AI / LLM:** OpenAI Python client for the optional triage path (default model `gpt-4o`); a rule-based deterministic mock as the default and fallback. (`langchain` / `langchain-openai` are also pinned in requirements — see Notes.)
- **Frontend:** React 18 with Create React App (`react-scripts`), REST + WebSocket client.
- **Data store:** local JSON files with atomic, lock-guarded writes — no database required to run.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (the code uses `int | None` / `dict | ToolCall` union syntax)
- Node.js 16+ and npm (for the dashboard)
- An OpenAI API key — only if you want to run the LLM triage path; the default mock needs nothing

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DCode-v05/Shop-Floor-Assitance.git
cd Shop-Floor-Assitance

# Backend deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Environment file
cp .env.example .env   # then edit as needed

# Frontend deps
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Running
```bash
# Backend (from repo root)
uvicorn server.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (in a second terminal)
cd frontend
npm start
```

The API serves on `http://localhost:8000` and the dashboard on `http://localhost:3000`. The React app reads `REACT_APP_API_URL` / `REACT_APP_WS_URL` if you need to point it elsewhere.

## Usage

1. Start the backend, then the frontend, and open `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Because the seed `machines.json` already has a machine at 125°C, the shop floor loop raises an S1 within seconds — watch the **Agent Workflow** panel produce an Event → Triage → Tools card and the action log fill in.
3. **Machines / Orders** panels reflect the JSON store (refreshed every 5s). **Safety Logs** lets you click *Mark Resolved*, which publishes a `safety_resolve` event.
4. To run your own scenario, POST an event:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/publish_event \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"source":"UI","type":"machine_upset","payload":{"id":"M2","temperature":130}}'
   ```
   Add `?async_mode=true` to enqueue and return immediately instead of processing inline.
5. To use OpenAI triage instead of the mock, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `USE_OPENAI_TRIAGE=1` in `.env` (optionally `TRIAGE_MODEL`), then restart.
6. Hit `GET /memory` at any point for a running tally of events processed and counts by category and severity.
